=======================
A simple chess program I'm developing for my own amusement. The program can be run as either a text-based program or in a (very) crude GUI. The text-based version is better for testing and comes with a substantial move generation tester using perft values. 

Board Representations
=====================
I plan to implement a few different board representations to see which one I like best. The current implementation uses 0x88, but I would like to implement a standard 8x8 board, a 15x12 board, and bitboards.

Move Generation
===============
Currently, pseudo-legal move generation is used. I may eventually move to a legal move generator but this works for now. 

Search Functions
================
I'm going to start with a NegaMax search. Next an alpha-beta search will be implemented. Once these are complete, I'll move on to things like iterative deepening and transposition tables.

Evaluation Functions
====================
At first a simple piece weight evaluation function will be used. I haven't done a lot of research on evaluation so I'll defer planning more until I get more knowledge on the subject.
